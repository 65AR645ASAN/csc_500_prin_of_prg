In Python, the 'and' and 'or' operators are logical operators used to 
combine multiple conditions or expressions.

 'and' Operator:
- The 'and' operator returns 'True' if both of the conditions are true.
- It evaluates from left to right and stops as soon as it encounters a condition that is 'False' (short-circuiting).

- Example:
  x = 5
  y = 10
  result = (x > 2) and (y < 15)   True, because both conditions are true


 'or' Operator:
- The 'or' operator returns 'True' if at least one of the conditions is true.
- It evaluates from left to right and stops as soon as it encounters a condition that is 'True' (short-circuiting).
- Example:

  x = 5
  y = 10
  result = (x > 2) or (y > 15)   True, because the first condition is true


Both operators are commonly used in conditional statements and loops to control the flow of the program based on multiple conditions.
