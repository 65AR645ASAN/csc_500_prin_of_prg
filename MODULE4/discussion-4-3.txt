To create a loop, several key constructs are required:

1. Initialization: Define the starting point of the loop.
2. Condition: A test to determine whether the loop should continue running.
3. Update/Increment: A step to modify the loop variable or condition to eventually terminate the loop.
4. Body: The block of code that is executed in each iteration of the loop.

 Scenario 1: Using a While Loop
Use Case: Continuously checking if a system service is running, and restarting it if it's not.

Details: This scenario requires a while loop because the number of iterations is unknown and depends on the dynamic condition of the system service status. The loop will keep checking the service status until it is running correctly.

Pseudocode:
```python
service_running = False

while not service_running:
    service_running = check_service_status()
    if not service_running:
        restart_service()
    sleep(10)  # Wait for 10 seconds before checking again

print("Service is now running.")
```

 Scenario 2: Using a For Loop
Use Case: Processing a fixed number of files in a directory and applying a specific operation to each file.

Details: This scenario requires a for loop because the number of files is known, and we need to iterate through each file exactly once.

Pseudocode:
```python
files = get_files_in_directory("data/")

for file in files:
    process_file(file)
    print(f"Processed {file}")

print("All files have been processed.")
```

 Feedback on Peers' Scenarios
Dylan's Post:
Dylan effectively explains the differences between `while` and `for` loops with clear and practical examples. The pseudocode provided is straightforward and easy to follow. The scenarios chosen, such as checking for a homeowner and processing paper submissions, aptly illustrate the use cases for each loop type.

Sadhana's Post:
Sadhana provides a detailed explanation of the key constructs required for loops and differentiates between `for` and `while` loops very well. The pseudocode examples for counting digits in a number and counting vowels in a string are excellent illustrations of how each loop type can be used. Including the step-by-step explanation of each example enhances understanding.

Adam's Post:
Adam's examples of loops in a game setting and robotics are insightful and highlight real-world applications of loops. The pseudocode for both scenarios is clear and demonstrates the use of `for` and `while` loops effectively. The explanation of the context in which each loop is used helps to understand the necessity of different loop types.

 Summary
- For Loop: Best for situations where the number of iterations is known and fixed, such as processing a specific number of data records.
- While Loop: Best for situations where the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a condition that changes during execution, such as continuously checking the status of a system service.
