Here are Python examples for each criterion to help illustrate the decision-making process between using predefined and user-defined functions:

1. Availability and Suitability: Use Predefined Functions When They Meet the Requirements Directly

Scenario: You need to sum a list of numbers.

Predefined Function: Use Python’s built-in `sum()` function, which is optimized and easy to understand.


# Using predefined function
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# The built-in sum function is perfect for this use case
total = sum(numbers)

print(total)  # Output: 15


Why Use a Predefined Function?
The `sum()-  function is already implemented in C and optimized for performance.
It is well-documented and widely understood by Python developers.
It meets the requirements directly without the need for additional custom logic.

2. Customization Needs: Create User-Defined Functions for Specific, Unique Logic

Scenario: You want to calculate a custom score based on specific criteria, which does not have a direct equivalent in Python’s standard library.

User-Defined Function: Create a function that encapsulates the custom logic.


# User-defined function for a custom scoring system
def calculate_custom_score(data):
    # Custom logic to calculate a score
    score = (data['value1'] * 2.5) + (data['value2'] * 1.5) + data['value3']
    return score

data = {'value1': 10, 'value2': 20, 'value3': 5}
custom_score = calculate_custom_score(data)

print(custom_score)  # Output: 60.0


Why Use a User-Defined Function?
The scoring system involves custom logic specific to your application.
A predefined function may not exist that performs the same operation.
Encapsulating this logic in a function makes your code reusable and easier to maintain.

3. Reusability and Maintainability: Encapsulate Repetitive or Complex Logic in User-Defined Functions

Scenario: You need to process customer data repeatedly across different parts of your application.

User-Defined Function: Encapsulate the processing logic into a function to enhance reusability and maintainability.


# User-defined function to process customer data
def process_customer_data(customers):
    processed_data = []
    for customer in customers:
        # Example processing: convert customer names to uppercase
        processed_data.append(customer.upper())
    return processed_data

customers = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']

# Using the function to process the list of customers
processed_customers = process_customer_data(customers)

print(processed_customers)  # Output: ['ALICE', 'BOB', 'CHARLIE']


Why Use a User-Defined Function?
The function `process_customer_data` encapsulates the logic of processing customer names.
It can be reused across multiple parts of the application, reducing code duplication.
Changes to the processing logic need to be made only in one place, making the code more maintainable.

Conclusion:

By considering availability and suitability, customization needs, and reusability/maintainability, you can decide when to use predefined functions versus when to create your own. Predefined functions are great when they directly meet your requirements and offer optimized performance, while user-defined functions provide flexibility and encapsulation of custom logic or repetitive tasks.
